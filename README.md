Architecture

    Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

    The SPA really allowed for dynamic traversal of the pages. It allowed the system to run pages for users that did not need to reload at every interaction. Also using Angular allowed for the usage of API and NoSql to hold and access data and bring in security measures that would have been otherwise difficult to include.

Functionality

    How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

    JSON allows for interactions between functionalities because its objects can be formatted to be used by most any format. These allow for a large diversity of uses across a variety of applications, especially this project. It was crucial in being able to Use API's in the system to access databases.

Testing

    Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

    Endpoints are the system's end goals for all operations, the methods are the way they interact. Methods allow for the communication of multiple endpoints to eork towards a common goal, but can become convoluted very easily. This is especially true when implementing security precautions into a system. Without proper testing, methods can become a tangled mess of information.

Reflection

    How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

    This course showed me what it is like to consider full stack development, and what it takes to fully understand a comprhensive system. It is a large task to complete product individually.
